# Boid-Flocking-Sim-for-multi-drones-navigation
Boid Flocking simulation implemented as part of a project meant to fly a swarm of tello drones from a point A to a point B and avoid obstacles. 

### The full explanation of this project is visible in the pdf SNAU_Report !
Videos of each functionalities and screenshort of different results are available in the sim folder. 

### After lauching the sim the boids progressively form tight swarms !

### The trajectories of the drones/boids can be tracked and sent to real drones !

### TO MAKE THE SIM WORK: 

!!! INSTRUCTIONS !!!

- Press M to launch the sim 

- Press L before M at the beginning to set random intitial velocity vectors
  (L can be pressed at any time to reset the velocities and scatter the boids) 
  
- Press R to start recording the positions of each boids 

- Hit the SPACE BAR to stop the simulation and stop the recording
